    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Viking flatbread is so flavorful. Using flours the Vikings might have used—spelt flour and rye flour—and moistening the dough with buttermilk rather than water, the f;atbreads have a bit of a sourdough note.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup spelt flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rye flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, spelt flour, rye flour, and salt in a bowl and stir with a wooden spoon to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour in buttermilk, and stir until a shaggy dough forms. Clean off the spoon and work the mixture with your hands until it comes together into a ball of dough, and the sides of the bowl are clean.</li>
        <li>Transfer onto a work surface, and using only enough flour to prevent sticking, knead until a smooth, elastic, and slightly sticky dough forms, about 2 minutes. Cover dough and let it rest for 15 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Divide into 6 equal portions and roll each one into a ball. Using just enough flour to prevent sticking, roll each portion out into a circle about 1/8-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat a dry cast iron pan over medium-high heat. Place in flatbread and cook until browned and blistered, about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Pile up cooked flatbreads on a plate and cover with a dry kitchen towel as they are being made. Let rest, covered, for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
